# PhoenixLogin v1.5.0 - Security Hardening & Polish Update 🚀

This major update brings critical security enhancements and a significantly polished user experience.

### 🛡️ **Critical Security Improvements**
- **Console Privacy**: Authentication commands (`/login`, `/register`, etc.) filtered from server console logs to protect player passwords.
- **Mandatory Captcha**: Anti-Bot Captcha is now **mandatory for ALL players** (new and registered) before authentication.
- **Strict Registration**: `/register` is completely blocked until the captcha is solved.

### 💎 **Visual & Experience Changes**
- **On-Screen Instructions**: New **Title & Subtitle** display instructing players to use the map captcha.
- **Clean Console**: Reduced startup noise with a beautiful ASCII banner and "Statistics Dashboard".

### 🔧 **Bug Fixes**
- **NBS Music**: Improved detection logic for NoteBlockAPI; warns if available but disabled.
- **Logging**: Fixed aggressive warning logs.
- **Performance**: Optimized inventory restoration flow.
